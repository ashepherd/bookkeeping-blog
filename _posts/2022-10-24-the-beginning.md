# How did I get here?

1. Obsession with personal finance since I was a teenager
2. Career computer programmer, moderate saver
3. At 45, technology has passed me by (it moves faster than my curiosity)
4. Coasting towards financial independence
5. Need meaning in my work - helping other people

# What are the questions I'm trying to ask?

1. How do you make a career pivot in my situation?
2. What will be my retirement cashflow strategy? tax avoidance strategy?
3. How will I become a homeowner? Should I?
