Last week, my girlfriend rented commercial space to begin her dream career move - owning a child therapy practice. I was so shocked (and scared) by how quickly she jumped at the opportunity. But her courage and confidence was inspiring. I've been helping her renovate the small place, and the more time I spent working alongside her, the more I thought about my own dreams. It occurred to me that while I have dreams, I'm not doing much to pursue them. 

Computer programmers almost by definition are lazy. We love to find ways to automate tedious and repetitive tasks. I may have leaned in to my lazy WAY too hard. How could my girldfirned just drive by some available commericial real estate and pull the trigger? She hadn't planned for how the rent was getting paid, what materials she'd need, or even built a potential client list......I thought. While she might not have written it down  (that I've seen), she's been actively thinking and perfecting her ideas for a long time. In full disclosure, she had a private pracitce in the past.

I'm a planner. I want to see all the angles and understand all the risks before jumping. My core wound in life is feeling *secure*. I want enough money. All assigned into neat little categories so that no expense feels like it snuck up on me. I don't want surprises when it comes to my security. Yet, I sit here in a career I no longer feel curious about, completely comfortable with the paycheck. And I know that this gig isn't forever. I'm good at what I do, I just don't love it anymore. So it's time for a change. To chase my dreams.

One of those dreams is to work with personal finance in some way. I LOVE the numbers. I LOVE the puzzle. Finding the place where a budget makes sense. I know that everyone has their own goals when it comes to financial planning. My goal - security - heavily influences how I decide to allocate my funds. To me, there is an exciting challenge of understanding _someone elese's goals_ and how a financial plan can be contructed to bring them success _and balance in life_.

Here it goes, I know nothing about becoming a bookkeeper or an accoutant, and CPA or CFP. I do know that these words have been mentioned around things I like. So what the heck, this is where I start. My first google search looking into how to get educated started with this result here on Investopedia:
